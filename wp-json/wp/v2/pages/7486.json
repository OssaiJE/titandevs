If the site loaded slowly, Google would penalize NewsletterGlue.com in the search rankings.

A quick win was to install the <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.cloudflare.com\/automatic-platform-optimizations-starting-with-wordpress\/#the-benefits-of-automatic-platform-optimization\">Cloudflare APO Plugin<\/a>.
