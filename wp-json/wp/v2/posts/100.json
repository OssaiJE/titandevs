It might be because you have decided to pursue your dream of blogging. It could be because you want to make a beautiful landing page for your wedding. Maybe it is the fact that your business is really taking off and you want to get it set up in the digital space. In this day and age, pretty much everyone has a reason to own a website, even if it is just for their own private musings. Fortunately, WordPress makes it easy for you to make a website in a few easy steps. At Clio, we absolutely love WordPress, which is why we decided to break down exactly how to set up your very own WordPress site. If at any point you get overwhelmed and want to hire a Calgary WordPress expert <a href=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/contact-us\/\">contact Clio<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"bottom30\">Setup An Account<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to making a WordPress site, your first step is always going to be to make an account. You can do this by going to <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">www.WordPress.com<\/a> and clicking the \u201cget started\u201d option on the main page. This will guide you through a simple account setup process where you will provide all of the contact and login information for your account. Your login information can be changed as needed at a later date, so don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t have a business email set up just yet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\" align=\"center\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/wordpress-1024x637.png\" alt=\"clio-websites-calgary-wordpress-website-design-wordpress-logo\" class=\"wp-image-109 bottom30 img-responsive\" width=\"329\" height=\"204\"><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"bottom30\">Register Your Domain<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As you complete the account setup, you will be prompted to provide a domain name for your website. WordPress will always give you the option to have a free domain. However, if you go with this route, you will find yourself with a domain name that has WordPress in the title. For example, it might read CalgaryWebsiteDevelopmentServices.WordPress.com instead of just CalgaryWebsiteDevelopmentServices.com. When you work with the free domain, you can always easily change it. This is a good option in the event that you are not completely certain what you want your web address to be just yet.\n<br><br>\nIn the event that you want your very own domain and are certain what you want to call it, you can always work with WordPress to establish the domain immediately. Depending on what kind of website you plan on running as well as what sales promotions they are offering, the pricing on this can vary. Choose the right package for you, and you will officially own your very own web domain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div align=\"center\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Domain-Registration-1024x635.png\" alt=\"clio-websites-calgary-wordpress-website-design-Domain-Registration\" class=\"wp-image-108 bottom30 img-responsive\" width=\"494\" height=\"306\" srcset=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Domain-Registration-1024x635.png 1024w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Domain-Registration-300x186.png 300w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Domain-Registration-768x476.png 768w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Domain-Registration-1536x953.png 1536w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Domain-Registration-2048x1270.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 494px) 100vw, 494px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"bottom30\">Build Your WordPress Website<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is an incredibly versatile host option that is known for allowing you to create completely custom websites. Depending on your needs, you might choose to use the provided website builder, or you might instead find that you want a completely custom website. If you are unfamiliar with coding and don\u2019t want to pay for a custom website option, you can always use the website builder tool. In the event that you are looking for something more custom, you might just find that it is worth paying someone like a Calgary website design company Clio Data Solutions to create a custom website for you.\n<br><br>\nThe website builder options provided by WordPress are actually fairly expansive. Depending on what your exact needs are, you can easily choose one of the free themes available. This will allow you to enjoy a nice looking website that has already been coded. At this point, it will just be your job to go in and fill out the various website features with your content and create your pages using the builder tool. WordPress themes are essentially templates that you can go into and fill with your very own content. WordPress makes it easy to do this with simple tabs on the left hand of the site.\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"bottom30\">Choosing a WordPress Theme<\/h2>\n\n\n\nA huge benefit to using WordPress themes is that they are actually fairly open. Since WordPress comes with amazing editor tools and allows you access to the code behind the theme, you can actually take an existing theme and customize it so that it doesn\u2019t look like all the others. Within the editor, you can easily change things like font or color to provide a more custom look to your website. This is particularly effective for people who have a little bit of coding knowledge. However, you do not need to know how to program in order to customize your website. Within the editor, WordPress allows you to easily add pages and various plug-ins in order to fully create the website that matches your vision. \n<br><br>\nIn addition to the free theme options, of which there are many, you can also opt to purchase a more custom theme. These specialty themes are designed by professionals and can usually be purchased for an incredibly reasonable amount of money. The benefit to this is that they tend to look a little nicer. The drawback is that you will end up paying a little extra. However, the prices can range from $5 to $200 depending on the theme that you are looking for.\n<br><br>\nOf course, the true power of WordPress is that you can easily custom code your very own website. This means that you have the option to create a website of your own if you have the ability to do. It also means that you can <a href=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/contact-us\/\">hire a website development company like Clio<\/a> to customize a website for you that can easily be loaded into your WordPress domain. This makes it possible for you to have the website of your dreams. The real benefit is that you can always start with a theme and transition to a custom website later as needed. WordPress allows for this seamless transition. Once your website is built, all you have to do is preview it and then put it online!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div align=\"center\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized bottom30\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/how-to-create-a-website-feature-image-e1496943224192.jpg\" alt=\"clio-websites-calgary-wordpress-website-design-create-website\" class=\"wp-image-107 img-responsive center\" width=\"427\" height=\"282\" srcset=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/how-to-create-a-website-feature-image-e1496943224192.jpg 441w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/how-to-create-a-website-feature-image-e1496943224192-300x198.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 427px) 100vw, 427px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"bottom30\">Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is an amazing tool that can help you to make a website that you are absolutely in love with.
