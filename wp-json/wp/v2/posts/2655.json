Currently, <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WordPress <\/a>is an industry leader when it comes to websites and website building, with each WordPress site granting the owner access to a variety of helpful plugins. Since this platform is so popular, it is easy to see why so many are looking for simple ways to sell products on their WordPress site, which is where <a href=\"https:\/\/woocommerce.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WooCommerce <\/a>comes in. Using this effective duo, you can easily design an online store in no time at all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Creating Your WordPress Site<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is a great space for building the website of your dreams, so you will want to start here. When it comes to designing your WordPress site, there are a few simple steps to follow. Using existing WordPress templates, you can build a fully functional site in a relatively short time frame. However, if you need a more custom site, you are able to design your own, purchase a custom template, or pay a developer to create a custom website for you. If you need help launching a WordPress template, <a href=\"\/contact-us\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reach out to Clio<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\" align=\"center\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" src=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/clio-websites-calgary-web-design-company-wordpress-woocommerce-body-1.jpg\" alt=\"clio-websites-calgary-web-design-company-wordpress-woocommerce-body-1\" class=\"wp-image-2658\" srcset=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/clio-websites-calgary-web-design-company-wordpress-woocommerce-body-1.jpg 600w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/clio-websites-calgary-web-design-company-wordpress-woocommerce-body-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/clio-websites-calgary-web-design-company-wordpress-woocommerce-body-1-560x373.jpg 560w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Effective WordPress Website<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to creating an effective WordPress website, you want to focus on your target market and make sure that your branding is in line. Branding is important for any business, but it is particularly relevant when it comes to creating an effective eCommerce site. A strong brand will help you to cater to your audience, which makes it much easier for you to build credibility with your customers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating credibility is crucial because it will make people trust you enough to buy your products or services. Even the best products in the world won\u2019t move if your customers think that they can\u2019t trust you or your website, so make sure that you use high-quality images, use readable fonts, and apply branding colors where you can. As soon as your website is up and running, you can begin to use WooCommerce to create your online store.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Understanding WooCommerce<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WooCommerce is a completely free WordPress plugin that allows you to create a full eCommerce store in no time at all. Instead of paying a developer to design your store or trying to design it yourself, this helpful plugin grants you access to a wide variety of helpful tools that make it possible for you to create a completely customized online store. In fact, WooCommerce is so easy to use that you can create a complete store in a matter of minutes, and if you want to make adjustments later, you can do that as well.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\" align=\"center\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/clio-websites-calgary-web-design-woocommerce-logo-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"clio-websites-calgary-web-design-woocommerce-logo\" class=\"wp-image-2660\" width=\"365\" height=\"205\" srcset=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/clio-websites-calgary-web-design-woocommerce-logo-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/clio-websites-calgary-web-design-woocommerce-logo-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/clio-websites-calgary-web-design-woocommerce-logo-768x432.jpg 768w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/clio-websites-calgary-web-design-woocommerce-logo-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/clio-websites-calgary-web-design-woocommerce-logo-560x315.jpg 560w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/clio-websites-calgary-web-design-woocommerce-logo.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 365px) 100vw, 365px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>This powerful plugin can offer you a wide range of eCommerce functionality and makes it possible for you to run an online store with absolute ease.
