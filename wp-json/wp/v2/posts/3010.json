When you first begin to pursue your web design options, you will want to consider ways to make your photography website engaging and visually appealing. No one wants to hire a photographer that doesn\u2019t seem to exude beauty with their business presence, which is why the way that you design your website is so important. We understand that you need a beautiful and efficient website that will make clients want to work with you. Using the right approach to design, you can make your website look like the perfect portfolio. This is why we wanted to share a few helpful tips to get you started.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Use a Clean and Open Design<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In photography, there are few things more important than the quality of the images. Web design works the same way. You want to focus on providing your visitors with an appealing sight when they click through your pages. Clean and open design choices can make your website look more professional and all-around more appealing. Instead of cluttering your pages with information and design elements, try and keep your design minimalistic. This will help you to highlight what is actually important, your photographs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><div align=\"center\"><img src=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/clio-websites-web-design-for-photographers-clean-photography-2.jpg\" alt=\"clio-websites-web-design-for-photographers-clean-photography\" class=\"wp-image-3022\"\/><\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Use Themed Images<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A major issue that people run into with adding images to their website is forgetting to keep them similar. As a photographer, chances are that you photograph plenty of different subjects and scenes. This doesn\u2019t mean that you can only choose one photoset. However, you want to choose images for your website that are similar in tone or color scheme. This will help your website to look more professional and better as a whole. When you use similar color patterns and vibrancies, you will notice that the pages flow much better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Making Sure Your Website is Responsive<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There is nothing more tragic than attempting to look at a company website on your phone and realizing that their website is not mobile friendly. The same is true when you visit a site on your computer and learn that it was only made for mobile. These limitations can cause problems for the overall credibility of your website, and consequently, your business. Putting in the extra work to make sure that your website looks great no matter how your customers view it is an excellent way to draw in new clients and put your best foot forward. At Clio, are websites are not only visually appealing, but they are guaranteed to look great on any platform. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><div align=\"center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"441\" height=\"291\" src=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/how-to-create-a-website-feature-image-e1496943224192.jpg\" alt=\"clio-data-solutions-calgary-website-design-create-website\" class=\"wp-image-107\" srcset=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/how-to-create-a-website-feature-image-e1496943224192.jpg 441w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/how-to-create-a-website-feature-image-e1496943224192-300x198.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 441px) 100vw, 441px\" \/><\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Photography Website Performance<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A great portfolio website will need to perform well and still look visually appealing in order to make the biggest impact. Showcasing your portfolio and ensuring that your website still performs well and loads fast can be tricky. We utilize tools and techniques such as lazy loading and caching in order to ensure that your web design for photographers product is successful.

Though you might not design your website yourself, you should be able to identify a good website when you see one. Take the time to look at available models or websites in order to get an idea surrounding what you want to see for your own website.
