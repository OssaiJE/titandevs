The general idea is that a responsive website will always look and feel right no matter what device you view it from. There are several different approaches that you can take to ensure a responsive web design, but one of the best ways to create a good design is through the use of scalability and certain navigation elements like buttons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" src=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/clio-websites-understanding-responsive-web-design-calgary.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3306\" srcset=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/clio-websites-understanding-responsive-web-design-calgary.jpg 600w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/clio-websites-understanding-responsive-web-design-calgary-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/clio-websites-understanding-responsive-web-design-calgary-560x373.jpg 560w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Easy to Manage Navigation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years, it has become apparent that what works on a desktop doesn\u2019t always translate perfectly to mobile. Navigating takes on a different approach when you have your fingertips instead or a mouse. Scalability is a large consideration when it comes to navigation. You can\u2019t simply shrink down a website and expect it to still be easy to navigate in a way that is intuitive. Sometimes, the situation calls for change. It is up to the designer to manage those needs and reconstruct them accordingly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buttons are one of the tools that translate well for navigation purposes. We have known how to use buttons to help people easily navigate a website for some time, but with the right design, it is a whole new experience. Previously, buttons were more like links. Now, buttons are guiding experience that can help your visitors to easily make their way from one page to the next, and can even help them to complete entire services with the right labels. The versatility of this tool is something that you can apply easily across multiple formats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Simple Interactions For Better Functionality<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The ways that we interact with certain technology elements are often taught. More often than not, you will notice that the way that you navigate a desktop system is different than how you would navigate a mobile system. While desktops largely rely on clicking and dragging, mobile interfaces allow for different approaches. In fact, mobile systems tend to be more fluid in design. They are often built around tapping, dragging, and swiping. Allowing your website to adapt to these needs can make it much more user friendly. Sometimes, websites change certain elements substantially when moving to mobile. However, more often than not, the two designs try to meet in the middle as the website is modernized.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not every desktop design will make it easy for you to simply shrink it down for a mobile interface. This is why responsive web design is so important. Fortunately, buttons allow users to embrace desktop functionality on a mobile device without causing any confusion. In fact, a good button design can be translated and rearranged as needed to adapt to the new circumstances directly from the desktop version. It is a great way to make website responsive without forcing it to look worse or offer less functionality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"398\" src=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/clio-websites-responsive-web-design-mobile-ux.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3307\" srcset=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/clio-websites-responsive-web-design-mobile-ux.jpg 600w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/clio-websites-responsive-web-design-mobile-ux-300x199.jpg 300w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/clio-websites-responsive-web-design-mobile-ux-560x371.jpg 560w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Touchscreen Element<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A big concern when scaling your website to be more responsive is the actual sizing element and how it interacts with touch. Computer screens tend to be wider and more open and rely on a small cursor for selection. If you were to simply adapt your website to a mobile screen, it would be nearly impossible to navigate. The buttons and other elements must be adapted to present well on a touchscreen, not simply fit on them. Even scaling your images and selecting them by a device type can keep your users from fast-tapping the wrong elements because the page is loading incorrectly due to the size of the image.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the majority of responsive design is built around the idea of a mobile interface, touchscreens are a huge consideration. In today\u2019s day and age, it is fairly safe to assume that any mobile device has a touchscreen. Whether it is a phone or a tablet, you will most often interact with mobile systems by touch. Fortunately, touchscreens and buttons pair together very well. Not only does it make it easy for visitors to interact with your website, but you can also rely on existing habits. Easy to manage pop-up offers and complex data entry becomes very easy with the help of properly placed buttons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Responsive Web Design at Clio<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many different ways to approach responsive web design, but ease of use is a key consideration.
