That\u2019s a first great step but it\u2019s only part of the puzzle. Promoting your website and content to potential users and clients is equally (if not more) important.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The world has slowly but surely moved to an online experience, and with it, comes a new form of promotion. Though previously companies would be forced to lean on TV commercials and billboards, the digital world has become a space for a wide range of advertising opportunities. As a small business owner, you will want to find an inexpensive way to reach your audience so that you can get them excited about what you have to offer. In this article, we will discuss easy ways for you to promote your business or website online.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Use Social Media To Promote Your Content<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Social media is one of the fastest and easiest ways to promote a business or website. Since social media accounts are inherently free, anyone can make one. This includes you! Chances are that your customers are spending the majority of their free time in these social media spaces. This is why all modern companies and brands are known to manage social media accounts. It is the easiest way to meet your audience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" src=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/clio-websites-calgary-web-design-promoting-your-content-social-networks.jpg\" alt=\"clio-websites-calgary-web-design-social-networks\" class=\"wp-image-3362\" srcset=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/clio-websites-calgary-web-design-promoting-your-content-social-networks.jpg 600w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/clio-websites-calgary-web-design-promoting-your-content-social-networks-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/clio-websites-calgary-web-design-promoting-your-content-social-networks-560x373.jpg 560w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating a social account for your business is about more than just making a page. Social media accounts allow you access to a huge audience if you take the right steps. By understanding the social media spaces that a brand like yours will fit, you can begin connecting with new customers and promoting your content. The use of tags on sites like Instagram makes it easy for you to find your audience while they scroll. It is a great opportunity for you to reach them when they are looking for content or products just like yours.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When promoting your business on social media, you will want to make a professional-looking account that accurately represents your brand. Post interesting content including advertisements, informational pieces, staff pictures, and other fun kinds. This will bring your page to life better than ever. Your goal is to make people want to engage with the content, and make sure to always talk to them when they do!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Create Unique Content To Make Your Website Easier To Find<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A major part of promoting your website or business is creating unique content. The more content that you add to your website, the more likely it is that you will be found by those looking for content or products&nbsp; like yours. Creating different pages on your website, blog posts, and getting links to your content will make it easier for you to reach your audience quickly. Making sure that the content that you create is high in quality and on-brand is important. When people see good content, they will be more interested in exploring your brand and linking to your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"500\" height=\"296\" src=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/clio-websites-calgary-web-design-promoting-your-content-unique-bookpages.jpg\" alt=\"clio-websites-calgary-web-design-promoting-your-content-unique-bookpages\" class=\"wp-image-3361\" srcset=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/clio-websites-calgary-web-design-promoting-your-content-unique-bookpages.jpg 500w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/clio-websites-calgary-web-design-promoting-your-content-unique-bookpages-300x178.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Use Search Engine Optimization To Widen Your Reach<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Search engine optimization (SEO) is a popular marketing term that merely means that you design your content to appeal to search engines. When people are online looking for businesses like yours, they will generally type related searches into the search bar. Your goal here is to create content on your page that appeals to the interests of search engines.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Search engines have a few different factors that they look for when it comes to weighing where a website will fall in a search. The goal is to make your website as credible by their standards as possible. To do this, you will want to use targeted keywords in your content, promise good load speeds, and get your content shared on social media platforms. Another important aspect of getting your content ranked is <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/beginners-guide-to-link-building\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">getting back links to your content<\/a>. All of these factors will help Google and other search engines to comfortably suggest your website to other people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" src=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/clio-websites-calgary-web-design-promoting-your-content-search-engines.jpg\" alt=\"clio-websites-calgary-web-design-promoting-your-content-search-engines\" class=\"wp-image-3360\" srcset=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/clio-websites-calgary-web-design-promoting-your-content-search-engines.jpg 600w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/clio-websites-calgary-web-design-promoting-your-content-search-engines-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/clio-websites-calgary-web-design-promoting-your-content-search-engines-560x372.jpg 560w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Use Paid Advertisement to Promote your Business<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the event that you want guaranteed promotion, paid opportunities are always a possibility.
