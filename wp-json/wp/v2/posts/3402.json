Not only does this tell your customers that you are proud to show off your Calgary restaurant in style, but it gives them a fun and engaging space to gather important information. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Patrons use restaurant websites to determine if a restaurant is a good fit for their next meal, which is why ensuring that your website is well designed is so important. In this article, we will address some key restaurant web design tips to make sure that your website looks appetizing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Branded Color Schemes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your restaurant should be known for its incredible atmosphere and delicious food. This means that you want to create a color scheme that supports the kind of environment and food that you are presenting. Many restaurants rely on neutral color schemes that help the images of their dining area and meal items to stand out. You want to highlight these areas, so don\u2019t distract with vibrant color schemes unless it is appropriate for your brand. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>#1 Calgary Restaurant Web Design Tip &#8211; Professional Photography<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For many people, looking at images of a restaurant will help them decide if the restaurant is a place that they want to visit. Professional photography can help you to show off your restaurant and menu in a great way. Pictures need to be well done to make sure that your environment looks welcoming, clean, and ready to serve up a tasty meal to any potential guests. Adding images is a great way to create buy-in from your customers. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We wrote about <a href=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/using-high-quality-photos-for-a-business-website\/\">how important professional photos are<\/a> in a previous post. This cannot be more true for restaurant websites. If you need some free photography to get started you can check out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pexels.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">pexels<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">unsplash<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" src=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/clio-websites-calgary-web-design-calgary-restaurant-web-design-restaurant-photo.jpg\" alt=\"clio-websites-calgary-web-design-calgary-restaurant-web-design-restaurant-photo\" class=\"wp-image-3641\" srcset=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/clio-websites-calgary-web-design-calgary-restaurant-web-design-restaurant-photo.jpg 640w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/clio-websites-calgary-web-design-calgary-restaurant-web-design-restaurant-photo-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/clio-websites-calgary-web-design-calgary-restaurant-web-design-restaurant-photo-560x373.jpg 560w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>A Welcoming Landing Page<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your website\u2019s main page will be the first glimpse of your business that customers see. A fast and clean landing page should welcome them in and encourage them to look around. You want to make sure that your website gives a good hint of what you offer, but avoids clutter. Many successful pages greet customers and invite them to learn more with good photos and web copy. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Easy To Navigate Menu Pages<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your menu is what customers will look for when it comes to deciding if they want to visit your restaurant. Having a clean set of menu pages that allow customers to easily explore what you have to offer can go a long way. This not only establishes your credibility and shows that you care, but it makes looking through your menu a fun and simple process. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, some businesses have individual pages for different types of meal items while others sort with on-screen interactive page elements. Your goal is to ensure that your customers can see all of the amazing menu items that you offer. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" src=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/clio-websites-calgary-web-design-calgary-restaurant-web-design-food-menu.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3639\" srcset=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/clio-websites-calgary-web-design-calgary-restaurant-web-design-food-menu.jpg 640w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/clio-websites-calgary-web-design-calgary-restaurant-web-design-food-menu-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/clio-websites-calgary-web-design-calgary-restaurant-web-design-food-menu-560x373.jpg 560w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Every restaurant owner knows that attracting in customers is crucial for business success. Competition in the restaurant industry is fierce and margin for error is small. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A simple and easy to navigate website will encourage people to choose you over the next restaurant on their list. Help your customers explore what you have to offer by giving them a website that they will love. You will enjoy the increase in traffic that it will bring!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why Choose Clio for your Restaurant Web Design<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"550\" height=\"750\" src=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/rics.jpg\" alt=\"rics-responsive-calgary-web-design-wordpress\" class=\"wp-image-1871\" srcset=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/rics.jpg 550w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/rics-220x300.jpg 220w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" \/><\/figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Clio Websites is a full service website design company in Calgary.
