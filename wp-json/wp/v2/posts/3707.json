Legal practices, like any other kind of business, need stunning modern websites to establish a good connection with potential clients. Since the average client will likely review your website to determine if you are the right fit, it is important to show them that you are a competent team of industry professionals who can help them to handle their legal matters. In this article, we will discuss some effective web design tips for legal practices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Clean, Professional Design<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From a design perspective, your ultimate goal is to create a professional appearance. This means that you want a clean and open design that is completely free of clutter. Your website should look just as organized as your case notes because that is what your clients will be thinking of. Show them how clear and concise you can be through your landing page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" src=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/clio-websites-tips-for-legal-practices-inner-image.jpg\" alt=\"clio-websites-tips-for-legal-practices-inner-image\" class=\"wp-image-3714\" srcset=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/clio-websites-tips-for-legal-practices-inner-image.jpg 600w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/clio-websites-tips-for-legal-practices-inner-image-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/clio-websites-tips-for-legal-practices-inner-image-560x372.jpg 560w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Professional and Approachable Color Themes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a law office, you want to maintain a special degree of professionalism. Unlike other industries that focus on flashy modern design, the law is meant to be mature, professional, and absolute. Show this image to your clients by providing them with neutral and approachable colors that help them to take you seriously. Black, white, grays, and even dark reds or blues can be a good match. Avoid bright colors that will make your page seem unprofessional or too playful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sharp Font Choices<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The law is murky and difficult to navigate for the average person, but as a legal professional, you can see it clearly. This is likely why the majority of law firms lean towards sharper serif fonts to show that they are straightforward and professional. Avoid smooth or overly artistic font choices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Crisp and Professional Images<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For legal practices, the right images can really instill confidence. It is common for legal practices to show images of their offices, images that are law-themed in nature, or person-focused images that remind your clients that you are there to support them. Make sure that your <a href=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/using-high-quality-photos-for-a-business-website\/\">photos are high in quality<\/a> and not too loud in tone. If you don&#8217;t have any custom photography, check out a site like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pexels.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Pexels <\/a>where you can download images for free.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"400\" height=\"600\" src=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/clio-websites-tips-for-legal-practices-inner-image-2.jpg\" alt=\"clio-websites-tips-for-legal-practices-inner-image-2\" class=\"wp-image-3713\" srcset=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/clio-websites-tips-for-legal-practices-inner-image-2.jpg 400w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/clio-websites-tips-for-legal-practices-inner-image-2-200x300.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Customer Reviews<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If there is one field that can benefit from sharing reviews, it is the law industry. Your clients want to know that you have helped other clients before them and been successful with it. With permission from your clients, it can be incredibly effective to share case studies, success stories, and reviews.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Web Design for Legal Practices &#8211; Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the same way that you would when meeting a client face to face, your entire goal is to show your clients that they can trust you. Everything about your website should instill confidence, encourage comfort, and demonstrate that you know your craft. Make sure that it is plainly visible on your website that you are the right group to help clients improve their lives and navigate difficult circumstances. Keep everything clean, even, concise, and deliberate. Your website is just another way to show potential clients that you are the group they have been waiting for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" src=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/clio-websites-tips-for-legal-practices-inner-legal-team.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3717\" srcset=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/clio-websites-tips-for-legal-practices-inner-legal-team.jpg 600w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/clio-websites-tips-for-legal-practices-inner-legal-team-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/clio-websites-tips-for-legal-practices-inner-legal-team-560x373.jpg 560w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why Clio Websites<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Clio Websites is a full service website design company in Calgary.
