In order to offer this, you want to use clearly defined lines, appropriate industry colors, and sharper font choices. These features come together to show that your website and business is as sturdy as your work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Use Approachable Language<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A common mistake that technical professionals make is overusing jargon. While you might be comfortable with common construction terms, your clients probably aren\u2019t. This can cause them to end up confused and uncertain about what you offer. Using approachable and friendly language can help your customers to better understand how your team can help them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Choose Industry Appropriate Photos<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/using-high-quality-photos-for-a-business-website\/\">Photography plays a large role<\/a> in lending credibility to a construction website. If you can, having a professional photographer shoot captivating photos of your actual work can work wonders. This will show off what you offer and will look professional at the same time. In case you can&#8217;t work with a professional photographer, it is best to opt for industry appropriate stock photos. You want to lean towards credibility rather than showing off your portfolio if you have to choose between the two.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>CraftING An Engaging \u201cAbout Us\u201d Page for a Construction Company<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For construction companies, \u201cabout us\u201d pages play a fairly large role. Many customers like to see what drives a construction team to work hard. This is an opportunity for you to engage your potential clients and show them why you are the best fit for the job. Focus on highlighting what makes your team stand out from the next company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Offer Helpful \u201cServices\u201d Pages<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Clients don\u2019t want to have to contact a company to learn what they can do. Having clearly defined service pages can help your clients to learn about what you can offer, making it easier to choose you. Breakdown your most common services on neatly written pages to clearly define why you are the right choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" src=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/clio-websites-web-design-for-construction-companies-construction-crew.jpg\" alt=\"clio-websites-web-design-for-construction-companies-construction-crew\" class=\"wp-image-3851\" srcset=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/clio-websites-web-design-for-construction-companies-construction-crew.jpg 640w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/clio-websites-web-design-for-construction-companies-construction-crew-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/clio-websites-web-design-for-construction-companies-construction-crew-560x373.jpg 560w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>wEB dESIGN FOR cONSTRUCTION cOMPANIES &#8211; Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a construction company, you want to instill absolute confidence in your work.
