If you\u2019re not sure where to start, stick with the basics: deciding on a color scheme and a logo. Finding a good color scheme is important to ensure that your business looks appropriate for the industry. Look at the color schemes of other businesses in your niche and see what you can learn.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a great logo has never been easier.

Website builders are tools designed specifically to help people with no coding experience create websites. Instead of forcing you to use code, you can simply choose a theme or, in some cases, widgets to easily build your website. Everything is already coded, so all you have to do is choose a good layout and then add your content. It\u2019s easy and anyone can make a beautiful web design in no time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every website builder has something different to offer. While some focus on keeping design easy or open to different styles, others are more limited and dedicated to creating very nice basic websites. Some builders have more features than others, which is why it is important to look around and determine which one has the right features that suit your needs. Some people prefer simple websites while others need something a little more technical. Fortunately, there are plenty of options to choose from.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some popular website builders that you can try:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>WordPress.com<\/li><li>Squarespace<\/li><li>Wix<\/li><li>Weebly<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>WordPress<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>At Clio, we love WordPress and use it for a lot of projects. It enables businesses to get started quickly and launch a website in no time but it&#8217;s unfair to call it a web builder since it offers so much more functionality.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a lot of benefits of using WordPress for your do it yourself small business website. The WordPress platform is flexible, expandable, and has lots of online learning resources. It offers lots of functionality such as e-commerce, blogging, as well as complex forms and applications.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the drawbacks of WordPress is that it can get complex and overwhelming. If you get stuck and need help, you can check out our <a href=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wordpress-developer-calgary\/\">maintenance plans<\/a>, or <a href=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/contact-us\">contact us<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Squarespace<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Squarespace is another popular web builder that offers a ton of resources and themes to choose from. It\u2019s easy to get started and this platform also offers e-commerce features. The drawback of using Squarespace is being restricted by a lack of functionality and the inability to customize the website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Wix<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Wix offers over 500 templates to help you create your first website. It\u2019s easy to use and you can get a website launched in no time. Some of the restrictions and drawbacks include:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Not having the flexibility to customize your website<\/li><li>Inability to grow beyond a simple \/ informational website<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Weebly<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Weebly offers the flexibility to get started quickly and also integrate e-commerce functionality. Similar to the other platforms mentioned above, this platform will restrict your growth and ability to customize as you grow.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Browse Available Themes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Themes are what makes website builders really pop. In the website building world, a theme is a custom website layout that has already been created for you by a professional. This is what gives you the ability to have a beautiful and professional looking website without actually hiring a design team to build one for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Website themes come in all shapes and sizes, making it fairly easy for you to find one that you like. Different styles can help you organize information better, show off a portfolio, or even give you the ability to run a blog for SEO purposes. They make it easy for you to begin filling your website with great content immediately. In most cases, you can change your theme at any point if you find a new one that matches your tastes better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:47% auto\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"407\" src=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/clio-websites-web-design-for-photographers-clean-photography.jpg\" alt=\"clio-websites-web-design-for-photographers-clean-photography\" class=\"wp-image-3022 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/clio-websites-web-design-for-photographers-clean-photography.jpg 600w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/clio-websites-web-design-for-photographers-clean-photography-300x204.jpg 300w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/clio-websites-web-design-for-photographers-clean-photography-560x380.jpg 560w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-background\" style=\"background:linear-gradient(320deg,rgb(238,238,238) 0%,rgb(169,184,195) 100%)\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h2>Add Good Images and Content to Your Do It Yourself Web Design<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When designing your do it yourself website, it\u2019s important to create great content.

Even the most professional template won\u2019t help you if you don\u2019t have good content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to choose the right images and web content, you will need to define your brand identity. This will be focused on how you want to present your business. You might want to come off as fun, professional, family-friendly, or relatable.
