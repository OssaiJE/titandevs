In this article, we provide some common real estate web design tips to make your company stand out from the competition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"E53\">Every realtor knows that so much of their personal success is directly correlated with presentation. Whether it is appearing professional, speaking clearly, or dressing up the perfect show home, it is important for realtors to impress straight out of the gate every time. This is why we wanted to offer a few quick tips to make the best website for the real estate industry. These principles can be used for realtors, real estate investors, and more!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"E57\">Open and Inviting<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"E60\">Think of your real estate website as an open house. You want everything about it to be incredibly welcoming and well-maintained. Just like you would for an open house, you will want to arrange your website in a way that shows off the best of what you have to offer. This means taking the time to invite them in immediately with an open layout.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"E64\">Try to keep each section of your website, particularly on the main page, as open and singularly focused as possible. Using bright and engaging photos, distinctive headers, and keeping branding information front and center can help them to relate more effectively with your brand. It will encourage your visitors to learn more about your group and what you have to offer!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/clio-websites-web-design-for-real-estate-agent-picture.jpg\" alt=\"clio-websites-web-design-for-real-estate-agent-picture\" class=\"wp-image-4050\" srcset=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/clio-websites-web-design-for-real-estate-agent-picture.jpg 500w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/clio-websites-web-design-for-real-estate-agent-picture-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"E68\">Traditional Design and Modern Flair<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"E70\">People need to know that their real estate agent is someone that they can trust. In order to convey this, you want to make sure that your website is very clearly defined. Using distinct lines and traditional shapes likes circles, squares, and triangles, you can add a degree of professionalism to your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"E74\">While realtors are fun people, the reality is that your clients are looking for professionals. Keeping your website professional in design can reinforce the notion that you are a trained expert who knows their industry. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that you have to follow what everyone else is doing. Adding modern flourishes in language or through the use of vibrant accent colors, you can dress up your brand that much more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"E78\">Color Contrast<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"E80\">The real estate industry is known for its use of high contrast in color choices. More often than not, they are built around a balance between neutral lighter colors and one darker shade that balances the look. Building contrast works wonders for making a brand look more defined in the eyes of a visitor. If you would prefer to veer away from the traditional scarlet and navy color options, feel free to dress your brand up with a bolder accent color like orange or yellow instead. You can also create a good design by bringing together different shades of the same color to keep a more consistent color flow throughout the website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"E84\">Answer Important Real Estate Questions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"E86\">The content that you put on your website can play a large role in its success. Real estate websites in particular have the ability to produce incredible high-quality content and you should incorporate this into your design. Consider offering up helpful immediate information on the primary page and then also building a blog or general content area. Good, fresh content will help you to perform better with search engines and will provide incredible value to your visitors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"E90\">For the average person, the real estate market is a total mystery. There are so many valuable bits of information that realtors have that can make quality content for their clients. Sharing insider knowledge is an effective way to provide a valuable reason for your clients to continue spending their time on your website. Additionally, it shows them that you know your stuff and helps to establish you as an industry professional that they can trust.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" src=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/clio-websites-web-design-for-real-estate-interior-picture.jpg\" alt=\"clio-websites-web-design-for-real-estate-interior-picture\" class=\"wp-image-4051\" srcset=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/clio-websites-web-design-for-real-estate-interior-picture.jpg 500w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/clio-websites-web-design-for-real-estate-interior-picture-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>SEO Tips for Real Estate Web Design<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Search engine optimization (or SEO) is one of the main considerations for real estate companies.
