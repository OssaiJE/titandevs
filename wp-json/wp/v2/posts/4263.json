Domain names can be purchased separately and don&#8217;t have to be tied to hosting, but a lot of hosting providers throw in a free domain with a hosting plan purchase.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 2 &#8211; Purchase good quality hosting<\/h3>\n<p>We recommend going with a reliable hosting provider. This is especially important for eCommerce websites. One of our favorite providers is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.siteground.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Siteground<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 3 &#8211; Launch your website<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.siteground.com\/tutorials\/getting-started\/start-new-website\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Follow this awesome guide from Siteground to launch your website<\/a>. Make sure you select the WordPress + WooCommerce option and follow the rest of the instructions.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 4 &#8211; Select and configure SSL<\/h3>\n<p>Installing an SSL certificate on your website will tell users that your website is secure and is highly recommended if you are collecting payments. Once again, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.siteground.com\/tutorials\/getting-started\/add-ssl-site\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">you can follow this guide from Siteground to install and configure your SSL certificate<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 5 &#8211; Select and install an appropriate theme<\/h3>\n<p>If you are following the Siteground website setup guide, you will be able to select a WordPress theme as one of the steps. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.siteground.com\/tutorials\/wordpress\/install-themes\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">You can also follow these instructions<\/a> in order to install a theme after the fact.<\/p>\n<p>We highly recommend selecting a fast and efficient theme for eCommerce stores. Some of our favorite options include <a href=\"https:\/\/generatepress.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GeneratePress<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/oceanwp.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OceanWP<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 7 &#8211; Customize your website to your needs<\/h3>\n<p>This is where things get a bit tricky, but if you picked a great theme, you won&#8217;t need much customization.<\/p>\n<p>You will want to change your website title, images, and upload your logo. <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/support\/article\/appearance-customize-screen\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Depending on your theme, all of these settings will be in the WordPress appearance customize menu item<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 8 &#8211; Fill out WooCommerce settings and enable payments<\/h3>\n<p>In order for your WooCommerce website to function, you will need to fill out the WooCommerce &gt; Settings options and enable your preferred payment method. We recommend PayPal or Stripe (for which you will need to create a business account for).<\/p>\n<h3>Step 9 &#8211; Start adding products<\/h3>\n<p>Adding products is pretty intuitive. Navigate to the Products menu on the left hand menu and click on Add New. Follow the prompts and fill out as much information as possible. In order for products to show up in your store and be purchasable, you will need to assign a price.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 10 &#8211; Promote your website and start selling items<\/h3>\n<p>This is the last step. Once your website is set up, your work doesn&#8217;t end here. You will need to promote your website using <a href=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/calgary-seo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEO<\/a> tactics in order to stay competitive and drive traffic to your website.<\/p>\n<p>If you get stuck or need any help, <a href=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/contact-us\/\">contact Clio Websites today<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Other eCommerce platforms for your online store<\/h2>\n<!-- \/wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are many other solutions that allow users to create a great eCommerce website.

One way to improve website security is by setting up an SSL certificate. An SSL certificate displays a padlock in a user\u2019s browser window indicating that the website is encrypted and \u201csafe\u201d. Not having an SSL certificate set up will display a security warning.\u00a0<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Google has indicated that having an SSL certificate impacts search engine rankings.

Creating your online brand and presence is just as important in convincing your clients to spend money on your website.\u00a0<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the next section, we cover some of the main branding considerations for your online store.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Brainstorm Your eCommerce Website Brand<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The first step to creating the perfect website is to sit down and take the time to really consider your brand. How do you want your customers to look at your company? Branding considerations should consider colors, images, and overall tone. Will you be approaching your customers with a casual way of speaking or do you want something more professional? Work hard to create a clear brand identity so that you can sculpt your website to match it.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Make Your Company Color Palette<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Creating your very own color palette is a crucial part of good website design. You want to make sure that your colors are clearly defined so that you can find a good way to design the website. Your color palette will be the only colors you reach for when designing, which will help your brand be more memorable, all while helping to keep your website consistent. Your color palette should have some contrast in it so you can highlight what is important and keep an even look.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Decide How To Present Your Products<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Organizing your products is a very important part of website design because it determines how your products will be shown. Some companies prefer to break their existing products down into easier to identify lines to make shopping easier. As you add more products, you will want to consider this so that you can get the most out of your customer experience.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The way that you present your products has more to it than you might think. You need to determine what webpages your products will be found on, as well as how they will be physically shown. Will your products have a small thumbnail that opens up when clicked or do you want a larger and more open design that shows off your products on the main product page?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After you have determined the appearance of the product page, consider if you want each product to also have their own page. Many brands use this to provide more information and also use it to really sell customers on the product. You might include a fun product description, material details, or even access to your product reviews. Overall, you want customers to really understand your product in a helpful way.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Use High-Definition Brand Images<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Whether you are selling products or services, you should absolutely have brand photos. Using clear high-definition photos that show off exactly what you are selling can go a long way in closing the deal on a big sale. When companies don\u2019t have clear and well-designed images, customers are more likely to back out of the purchase at the last minute.\u00a0<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>By providing them with good photos, you can show them exactly what they are investing in. We feel so strongly about this, we have written a separate blog post regarding the <a href=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/using-high-quality-photos-for-a-business-website\/\">importance of good photgraphy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Be Helpful<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The easiest way to make a good website is simply to be helpful. Consider the needs of your customers and focus on creating a website that suits those needs.\u00a0<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What kind of helpful information can you offer your customers? Is there any reason to add a Q&amp;A page to help customers learn more about your brand? Do you have a welcoming \u2018About Us\u2019 page that shows customers how your brand got started and why they should consider you?\u00a0<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Focus on meeting your customers halfway by providing them with easily accessible information that tells them everything that they need to know in order to invest in your brand.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4277 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/ecommerce-websites-clio-websites-delivery-picture.jpg\" alt=\"ecommerce-websites-clio-websites-delivery-picture\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" srcset=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/ecommerce-websites-clio-websites-delivery-picture.jpg 500w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/ecommerce-websites-clio-websites-delivery-picture-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Promoting your eCommerce website using SEO<\/h2>\n<!-- \/wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once you have successfully built and launched your website, your work is far from over. Promoting your website in order to get leads and generate sales is even more important. There are two ways to promote your website.

This promotion method includes purchasing Google Ads or Facebook Pixel credits. Using SEM practices is key in order to promote a newly launched business.

Using paid marketing techniques generates immediate traffic until organic SEO takes off.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Search engine optimization or SEO is the process of tuning a website for better search engine performance.
