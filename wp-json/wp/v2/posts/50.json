If you are running a business in this age, being able to provide your customers with a high quality website is absolutely crucial. Due to the ever-growing popularity of websites, more people are looking for ways to make them than ever before. This has led to an increase in ways to obtain a website. Now, people have the option to decide between website builders, free services that operate in a website builder capacity, and completely custom websites. With this many options, many people are finding it more and more difficult to determine just which approach they should take when it comes to creating the website of their dreams. While website builders offer a helpful and easy approach, the fact of the matter is that nothing truly compares to having a website built by a true professional. Getting the right Calgary web design team in your court can help you to dramatically improve your web presence. Instead of having a website that looks nearly identical to every other one in your industry, you can have a website that stands out and demands attention. In this article, we will discuss the real reason why you should have a custom website built.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image bottom30\" align=\"center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"419\" src=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/blur-close-up-contemporary-1029757.jpg\" alt=\"Clio Websites - Calgary Web Design and WordPress Company - Computer Screen Picture\" class=\"wp-image-49\" srcset=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/blur-close-up-contemporary-1029757.jpg 640w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/blur-close-up-contemporary-1029757-300x196.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"bottom30\"><strong>Website Builders &#8211; The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p align=\"justify\" class=\"bottom30\">Website builders are a great way to approach website building in the event that you need something very quick and very basic. The true benefit to them is that you can realistically build a functional website over the course of a few hours. This means that in the event you have a reason to produce a website on a limited schedule, you will find a good approach here. However, website builders have a tendency to be limited in terms of actual website functionality (such as displaying your company branding). They are often fairly limited in customization as well. While you might very well end up with a nice looking website, the reality is that you will likely also end up with a generic looking website as a consequence of this decision. Since your website is going to be composed of existing pieces and templates, chances are that several other websites will look nearly identical. While this might not be the worst thing, it can drastically limit your website\u2019s ability to stand out.<\/p>\n\n<h2 class=\"bottom30\"><strong>The Power of Website Customization<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p align=\"justify\" class=\"bottom30\">Having a custom website built is an approach that some people have hesitations about. Custom websites generally take a longer amount of time to build, and this duration can differ depending on the actual complexity of the website. Since every website has different needs when it comes to appearance and functionality, it is easy to see how this timeline can differ. A basic website might only take a couple of weeks while a complicated e-commerce site might take a few months to launch. Though it might take longer for the website to be built, the benefit is that you will have a website that has been tailored to your exact needs and preferences. Your website will look the way that you want it to and will have all of the various functionality options that you will need for your specific business. \n<br><br>\nThis is great for a few reasons. First, you will never have to worry about finding workarounds for certain functional options on the website.  Many people who use website builders find that they simply cannot meet their exact needs. Using a Calgary web design professional can fix this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image bottom30\" align=\"center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/design-development-electronics-326424.jpg\" alt=\"Clio Websites - Calgary Web Design and WordPress Company - Design Picture\" class=\"wp-image-46\" srcset=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/design-development-electronics-326424.jpg 640w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/design-development-electronics-326424-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p align=\"justify\" class=\"bottom30\">When a site is custom built, you will not have this issue. When you take the custom approach, the developer will take the time to sit down and discuss your every need for the website. This will include a combination of discussing functionality, layout, and aesthetic. These developers can perfectly design your website in a way that will serve you and your customers. As an added bonus, they will be able to use all of your branding materials in order to help you to get a website that truly matches your company\u2019s vision. Instead of relying on color pickers or basic branding imports, your branding materials and themes can be easily embedded directly into the website so that people know that it is your company website the second that they land on it. Having the ability to make it easy for customers to see your company with your website branding is an excellent way to increase your overall brand recognition.<\/p>\n\n<h2 class=\"bottom30\"><strong>The Branding Boost of Good Web Design<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p align=\"justify\" class=\"bottom30\">When it comes to running a successful business, particularly when you are first starting, it is important to increase your credibility with your customers. Having a strong and well-designed website is an excellent way to do this. Since many people interact with company websites on a daily basis, it is important to have a proper landing page for them. If your website looks too generic or wasn\u2019t created with users in mind, it will be apparent immediately. This is a quick way to establish yourself as a company that just isn\u2019t quite there yet. When you have a custom website built, you are relying on the fact that the developer knows how to design a successful user interface. While you might be able to arrange pieces in a website builder, there is a tried and true science behind how websites should be designed in order to make them easy to use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image bottom30\" align=\"center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" src=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/blur-cellphone-close-up-196644.jpg\" alt=\"Clio Websites - Calgary Web Design and WordPress Company - Design Mockup Picture\" class=\"wp-image-47\" srcset=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/blur-cellphone-close-up-196644.jpg 640w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/blur-cellphone-close-up-196644-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p align=\"justify\" class=\"bottom30\">A good developer will know what it takes to create a great user interface that serves your users well. When people encounter a website that is not intuitive, they are quick to get frustrated and can cast a negative judgment on your company. In order to avoid this, it is best to leave the true design approach to the professionals. Website developers know what it takes to create a website that users will love, and they can do it in a way that aligns with your personal ideals and preferences. In order to have the best possible website for your company, there simply is no true substitute for having a custom website designed and built by a talented web designer.<\/p>\n\n<h2 class=\"bottom30\"><strong>Summary<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p align=\"justify\">When you are working on presenting your company or platform in the best possible light, you want to give your company the greatest chance. Many people are of the belief that it is outlandishly expensive to have a custom website built, but the reality is that there are a variety of pricing options that are available. You can enjoy a completely custom site for a price that you can afford. In fact, Clio offers payment plans and monthly subscriptions. \n<br><br>\nWorking with a professional web designer is a great way to get the edge on your competition and end up with a website that you absolutely adore.
