There are many companies and consultants that claim to do it, but few actually can.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On-page SEO is the practice of optimizing individual web pages in order to rank higher and earn more relevant traffic in search engines.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On-page refers to both the content and HTML source code of a page that can be optimized, as opposed to off-page SEO which refers to links and other external signals. This is because on-page SEO has a direct impact on a website\u2019s performance in the search results. A good Calgary SEO company can help you improve your on-page SEO performance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In today\u2019s SEO landscape, you have to win before you even enter the arena.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Long gone are the days of stuffing your content with keywords and ranking in Google\u2019s top 10. In fact, stuffing your content full of keywords will likely negatively impact how your page ranks in Google.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s what you need to consider before diving into on-page SEO:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Keyword research &#8211; both long-tail and general keywords;<\/li><li>Meta tags, headings, and internal linking;<\/li><li>Content.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\t\t<div data-elementor-type=\"section\" data-elementor-id=\"5586\" class=\"elementor elementor-5586\" data-elementor-settings=\"[]\">\n\t\t<div class=\"elementor-section-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-section elementor-top-section elementor-element elementor-element-465b76e0 elementor-section-stretched elementor-section-full_width elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-invisible\" data-id=\"465b76e0\" data-element_type=\"section\" data-settings=\"{&quot;stretch_section&quot;:&quot;section-stretched&quot;,&quot;animation&quot;:&quot;slideInLeft&quot;}\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column elementor-element elementor-element-62f6c397\" data-id=\"62f6c397\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-7df138db elementor-cta--skin-cover elementor-cta--valign-middle elementor-bg-transform elementor-bg-transform-zoom-out elementor-widget elementor-widget-call-to-action\" data-id=\"7df138db\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"call-to-action.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-cta\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-cta__bg-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-cta__bg elementor-bg\" style=\"background-image: url(https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/clio-websites-blog-header-Calgary-Downtown.jpg);\"><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-cta__bg-overlay\"><\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-cta__title elementor-cta__content-item elementor-content-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tContact Us\t\t\t\t\t<\/h3>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-cta__description elementor-cta__content-item elementor-content-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIf you have any questions, or want to get started today, get in touch with us.\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-cta__button-wrapper elementor-cta__content-item elementor-content-item \">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"elementor-cta__button elementor-button elementor-size-sm\" href=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/contact-us\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tContact Us\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\n\n\n\n<h3>Keyword Research<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you start anything SEO-related, you should have at least some knowledge of what queries your potential customers are searching for. We can help you identify effective and noncompetitive keywords as part of our Calgary SEO offering.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These can be related to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Their problems;<\/li><li>Needs;<\/li><li>Their curiosities.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Keyword research is the process of finding the keywords your target audience uses when looking for things online.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The keyword research process can be broken down into three steps \u2013 keyword discovery, competition analysis and keyword ranking. And, while a lot of people get hung up in the details, you can get started with just a few simple tools and a bit of knowledge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Keyword Discovery<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a step back and create a list of keywords you <em>think<\/em> your customer would search for if they wanted to find you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are a CBD business, you could start by building a list of similar keywords:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>CBD oil;<\/li><li>benefits of CBD;<\/li><li>CBD companies;<\/li><li>CBD supplements.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>Competition Analysis<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>What businesses appear on the first positions of Google when searching for some of these keywords?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are they established businesses? Do you know them? Are the results filled with forums, Wikipedia links, or Reddit?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowing your competition is paramount to a successful strategy. Some of the keywords you think of can simply be too hard to rank for at this point in time. They also might require more advanced SEO strategies to be able to outrank your competitors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Keyword Ranking<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Search engine rankings have become the single most important part of any online marketing campaign.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To achieve top rankings in the search engines, you need to understand how they work and how to rank your website page using smart SEO strategies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keyword ranking refers to how high or low your website appears in search engine results pages (SERPS) for a given keyword.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, keyword rankings aren\u2019t set in stone. Several elements can cause your website to move up or down the SERPs for any given keyword such as search volume, competition, and content quality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The concept behind keyword ranking is: the higher your page is ranked in the search engine&#8217;s index, the more likely searchers will be able to locate your page and visit it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best keyword ranking comes from a combination of factors, including how relevant your content is in relation to key terms and how often users are finding your page via Google search.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s explore how you can optimize for those keywords and get top spots on the first page of Google.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>On page Optimization &#8211; Meta Tags, Headings and Internal Linking<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several ways to help you rank higher on Google, but one of the most important is with on-page optimization.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On-page optimization is about as old school as it gets when it comes to SEO. But it\u2019s a process that should never be forgotten because SEO is more than just off-page factors like links and social shares.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> On-page SEO keeps you focused on what your audience is looking for and how to give it to them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are 3 main elements that you should pay attention to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Meta tags;<\/li><li>Heading tags;<\/li><li>Internal and external linking.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>Meta tags<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The meta tags refer to meta titles and meta descriptions. These are the text snippets that appear on the search engines. These help Google and users understand what your page is about.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A web page&#8217;s meta title is the text that appears in your browser tab, and it&#8217;s also the text that search engines display underneath your page title in search results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the meta title is not a required component of a page, there are several reasons why you should make use of them. A well thought out title can increase your ranking in search engine results and improve click-through rates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A meta title should:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Be clear and concise;<\/li><li>Have between 55 and 155 characters;<\/li><li>Include your brand name at the end, when possible;<\/li><li>Include the target keyword.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, a meta description is one of the most important HTML snippets on your page.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important to have a meta description on each page of your site because search engines often use these descriptions to display snippets in search results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meta descriptions are also used on social media. Google, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn all use meta descriptions to create a preview when a link to your web page is shared on their site.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The snippet of text is usually based on the first few sentences of your meta description, so it&#8217;s important that the message you want to get across is clear and concise, while still appealing to users.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Heading tags<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Headings (&lt;h1&gt; through to &lt;h6&gt;) guide people through long articles and help search engines understand your content.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They tell the reader what a certain paragraph is about so that they know whether or not to continue reading. Without them, readers will be lost through the huge amount of information provided, and won&#8217;t know where to look next.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the web, as in any written story, heading tags establish a hierarchy that allows users to scan a page, jump sections and find what they are looking for.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We start with H1\u2019s for the most important sections on the page. Each section creates its own section of H2\u2019s, then H3\u2019s if more detail is needed. Sometimes, even smaller sections need a heading tag, all the way down to H6.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The benefit of using heading tags is the improved ability to determine relevance when looking at a site for information and speed when quickly scanning a page for keywords.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Internal and external linking<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Internal links refer to links that go from one of your website\u2019s pages to another. They pass on trust signals and can often help improve ranking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are particularly important when you want to build links to content within your own website. Say you are selling CBD supplements for dogs. You want your product page to rank for \u201cCBD supplements for dogs\u201d, but the keyword is highly competitive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Internal linking can help you link from long-form content pieces that touch upon the subject and using \u201cCBD supplements for dogs\u201d anchor texts.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, external links are equally important. These are links from your website to pages on other websites. External links are more valuable when they link to high authority websites, rather than blogs or low authority domains.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve talked about internal and external links, but how do you create effective content you can link from?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Content Marketing<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Content marketing is an essential part of your SEO strategy. With content marketing, you&#8217;ll get in front of the right people, at the right moment with the right message.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s important to try to create unique content, rather than spilling out the same information over and over again. This can be done through:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Original research;<\/li><li>New tested strategies;<\/li><li>Case studies and learnings;<\/li><li>Step-by-step processes;<\/li><li>How-to guides.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing unique content is not enough. You need to provide valuable information that actually helps the user and moves them from the top of the funnel to the bottom of the funnel, ready to buy your product.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your content can include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Videos<\/strong>;<\/li><li><strong>Infographics<\/strong> are the perfect way to ensure that your message will be retained by its readers. In fact, you\u2019ll find that user retention will go up dramatically when you include an infographic, as they tickle several areas of the brain. Overall comprehension is far greater with infographics and their use should definitely be considered.<\/li><li><strong>Updated content <\/strong>&#8211; taking a new perspective on content creation can spark curiosity among users.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Your new piece of content needs to satisfy the user intent. If you\u2019ve done your keyword research right, readers will be able to find you using specific search terms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what happens if a user lands on your page and they don\u2019t find what they are looking for? That\u2019s a bad user experience. Make sure that your content covers the topic thoroughly and that it provides an answer to the users.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On-page content is great when you do it right. However, how do you make sure your pages are getting the attention they deserve? How do you build up authority to your site?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s where off-page SEO comes into play.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"500\" height=\"332\" src=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/calgary-SEO-clio-websites-phone-maps-search-results-picture.jpg\" alt=\"calgary-SEO-clio-websites-phone-maps-search-results-picture\" class=\"wp-image-5593\" srcset=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/calgary-SEO-clio-websites-phone-maps-search-results-picture.jpg 500w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/calgary-SEO-clio-websites-phone-maps-search-results-picture-300x199.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>OFF-PAGE SEO<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Off-page SEO refers to all SEO tactics that take place outside of your website, such as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Link building strategies;<\/li><li>Guest posting;<\/li><li>Social media.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>An effective off-page SEO strategy will help you boost your visibility in organic search, establish trust with users and improve your website traffic too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Link Building&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Link building is all about earning valued links from other websites.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can post content on your own website to encourage others to link back to you in their blog posts and articles.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could also reach out to industry-related blogs to ask for someone to write about the benefits of your business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Google\u2019s been known to penalize certain black hat link building tactics, such as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Paying for links;<\/li><li>Exchanging links;<\/li><li>Hidden links.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>White-hat link building is helpful for a number of reasons. First, Google pays more attention to links that point to a website from other popular sites. That\u2019s why you always want to aim for links from high authority, relevant websites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, links can be used to communicate a message or tell the search engines what your website is about. A health website linking to your cars website will definitely not help much. However, a news website launching a press release on your newly launched car business can definitely boost your rankings long term.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key is writing high-quality content that gets attention, shares, and pings. But how do you do that on a low budget?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Social Media Management<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Social Media is an underrated link building tactic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although social media links do not directly contribute to your SEO efforts, they can definitely boost traffic and bring relevant users to your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Social media marketing is about building a strong relationship with your fans. The more conversations you can generate, the better your brand will be perceived.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re a brand that wants to use content marketing as a way to reach more people, then social media can be your starting point.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" src=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/calgary-SEO-clio-websites-link-building-chain-picture.jpg\" alt=\"calgary-SEO-clio-websites-link-building-chain-picture\" class=\"wp-image-5596\" srcset=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/calgary-SEO-clio-websites-link-building-chain-picture.jpg 500w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/calgary-SEO-clio-websites-link-building-chain-picture-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>TECHNICAL SEO AND UX &#8211; Our Core Calgary SEO Offering <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a strong technical foundation is critical for doing SEO well. So, what is a strong technical foundation?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since search engines rely on certain technologies to crawl and index your site, technical SEO is focused on building a site that can be crawled and indexed effectively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Technical SEO includes website performance improvements and page-level optimizations. These internal site changes can boost the ranking of pages on your site without any link building or external factors.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Often, technical SEO is the first step in building a starting point for your organic traffic efforts.&nbsp;At Clio, we specialize in technical SEO and this is a core offering for Calgary SEO services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Technical Analysis<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to have your content ranked by Google, it needs to be indexed and crawled.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Technical analysis refers to the nitty-gritty of your site. It\u2019s related to optimizing page titles, meta tags, alt tags, and image filenames.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also entails setting up redirects in place and getting the 301s working properly. It\u2019s making sure that your analytics platforms are installed correctly and functioning.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, it\u2019s adjusting your mobile responsiveness to make your site super-friendly for your visitors who are browsing on a mobile device like a tablet or their smartphone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>SEO-friendly Website Development<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>More often than not, websites start working on their SEO efforts at a later stage in their business. This can lead to a lot of issues that could take too much time and too many resources to solve.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, starting with SEO even before you develop your website can help you get ahead of your competition.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some pieces you should take care of right from the start:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Optimize your robots.txt file<\/strong>. This file gives certain instructions to the search engines on which pages you want to be indexed and crawled. For example, you always want to block admin pages from being seen by Google;<\/li><li><strong>Your URL structure needs to be well defined<\/strong>. You should avoid using unusual characters in your URLs, such as \u201c?\u201d, \u201c_\u201d or \u201c.\u201d. Also, your URLs should include your target keywords, and exclude any URL parameters that don\u2019t make sense;<\/li><li><strong>Make sure there aren\u2019t any 404 pages on your website<\/strong>. 404 error pages are frustrating and intimidating to visitors, and confusing to crawl robots. They annoy the user, and they could cause visitors to leave your site altogether. Make sure that you either redirect these pages or personalize them.<\/li><li><strong>Your website should have an SSL certificate installed<\/strong>. HTTPS encrypts the connection and makes users feel safe from man-in-the-middle attacks. Hence, adding it to your site is a step in the right direction, if you care about both users and rankings.<\/li><li><strong>You should optimize your website for mobile devices<\/strong>. The number of users accessing the internet through mobile phones is growing rapidly. Businesses that treat their website as merely a desktop version are going to find it difficult to capture the attention of their target market.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\t\t<div data-elementor-type=\"section\" data-elementor-id=\"5586\" class=\"elementor elementor-5586\" data-elementor-settings=\"[]\">\n\t\t<div class=\"elementor-section-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-section elementor-top-section elementor-element elementor-element-465b76e0 elementor-section-stretched elementor-section-full_width elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-invisible\" data-id=\"465b76e0\" data-element_type=\"section\" data-settings=\"{&quot;stretch_section&quot;:&quot;section-stretched&quot;,&quot;animation&quot;:&quot;slideInLeft&quot;}\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column elementor-element elementor-element-62f6c397\" data-id=\"62f6c397\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-7df138db elementor-cta--skin-cover elementor-cta--valign-middle elementor-bg-transform elementor-bg-transform-zoom-out elementor-widget elementor-widget-call-to-action\" data-id=\"7df138db\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"call-to-action.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-cta\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-cta__bg-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-cta__bg elementor-bg\" style=\"background-image: url(https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/clio-websites-blog-header-Calgary-Downtown.jpg);\"><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-cta__bg-overlay\"><\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-cta__title elementor-cta__content-item elementor-content-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tContact Us\t\t\t\t\t<\/h3>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-cta__description elementor-cta__content-item elementor-content-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIf you have any questions, or want to get started today, get in touch with us.\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-cta__button-wrapper elementor-cta__content-item elementor-content-item \">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"elementor-cta__button elementor-button elementor-size-sm\" href=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/contact-us\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tContact Us\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\n\n\n\n<h2>BUSINESSES WE WORK WITH<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Local SEO<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Local SEO is like business insurance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You make sure that if a business owner has a fire in their building, they will be covered, and will not have to worry about not being able to continue paying the bills and keeping their doors open.&nbsp;We are also a local business, and we love helping other local business succeed by using our local Calgary SEO services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Local SEO is crucial for anyone who needs to attract local customers from a search engine locally, especially a brick and mortar business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also gives your local business maximum exposure to local users who are looking for the type of product or service that you provide.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although on-page SEO and technical SEO tactics remain roughly the same across local and national businesses, local SEO strategies differ a bit through their unique way of acquiring more organic traffic:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>While for national SEO businesses, link building strategies work across a variety of websites, for local SEO you would want to focus mainly on local citations and local links &#8211; think of citations from Apple, Bing, or Yellow Pages;<\/li><li>Keywords for local SEO businesses might be different, in that they target \u201cnear me\u201d queries. When someone from Calgary looks for a coffee shop, they are more likely to search for \u201cCalgary coffee shop\u201d;<\/li><li>Your local business needs to have a strong presence on Google Maps. Google Maps ranking factors range from relevancy, prominence, and distance.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If your local business is small, try not to compete with Starbucks, but rather with other small mom and pop businesses that are easier to outrank.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ecommerce SEO<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ecommerce SEO focuses mainly on product optimizations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a complex SEO strategy, and many sellers don\u2019t understand the widespread benefits. SEO makes it possible for online stores to compete with Amazon, your local grocery market, and more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, our strategy is to find and focus on keywords for your ecommerce segment that have a low competition level and high search volume. We run a competitor analysis for your ecommerce segment and use these keywords to create content that provides value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A combination of SEO efforts and PPC strategies can get you ahead of the competition, by uncovering low competition keywords that would otherwise get unnoticed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Voice SEO<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Voice search is the future of SEO. You\u2019ve probably heard about it, but do you know how it works and what challenges it presents? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s what you need to know!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voice SEO ties closely to local SEO, as it\u2019s often related to \u201cnear me\u201d keywords.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ve probably used an Alexa or Google device at some point in your life, being too lazy to browse the internet on your mobile.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHey Alexa, what&#8217;s the best pizza restaurant near me?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s where voice SEO comes into play. Such a strategy can essentially help your website \u201crank\u201d for voice search.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voice SEO works best for small, local businesses. Optimizing your product pages and Google Maps rankings can help you secure a personalized response from Alexa including your name and having one more customer join you. We can help you tune your website for voice SEO with our Calgary SEO service offering.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" src=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/clio-websites-people-working-in-office-picture.jpg\" alt=\"clio-websites-people-working-in-office-picture\" class=\"wp-image-5600\" srcset=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/clio-websites-people-working-in-office-picture.jpg 500w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/clio-websites-people-working-in-office-picture-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>CALGARY SEO CONCLUSION<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While SEO might sound overwhelming, small businesses can also use these strategies to rank and gain search traffic.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be profitable, you have to prioritize your marketing investment and focus on tactics that will give you the best results.
