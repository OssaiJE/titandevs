To learn more about our WordPress plans, <a href=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wordpress-developer-calgary\/\">visit this page<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the answers to some of the most common questions we get asked by small business owners. Bookmark this page, as we will be adding new content.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Is WordPress free?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is an open-source project. It&#8217;s free to download, modify, and use. You will need a hosting account to launch your own WordPress site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WordPress.com<\/a> is different. It&#8217;s a paid subscription-based product for blogging and building websites (like Wix).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Do I need to know PHP to work with WordPress?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Not unless you are planning to create your own themes and plugins. PHP is also useful for troubleshooting WordPress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You won&#8217;t need it in order to create and launch websites however.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Do I need to know Programming to launch a WordPress Website?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No. You can also use a visual designer such as Elementor, or Beaver Builder. Having a good quality and customizable WordPress theme makes this process easier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coding is helpful when users want to modify, customize, and troubleshoot their website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How do I install WordPress?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Most hosting companies have a 1-click type installation process for launching WordPress websites. If they don&#8217;t the process is a bit more complex.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a new WordPress user, I recommend picking a hosting company that offers easy WordPress installation.&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.siteground.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Siteground<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/kinsta.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Kinsta <\/a>are great options for hosting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Can I install WordPress on my computer?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes you can. You will need to set up a MAMP, WAMP, or LAMP environment (a bit more advanced).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the easiest options is to install a desktop application like Local WordPress (<a href=\"http:\/\/localwp.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">localwp.com<\/a>).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Do I need a theme for WordPress to work?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, every WordPress website needs a theme in order to run.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress comes with vanilla themes installed, or you can download free or paid themes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Which WordPress theme do you recommend?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I recommend a fast theme. Some of my favorite themes include GeneratePress, Hello Elementor, Astra, and OceanWP depending on the project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A quick and efficient theme will make or break your website performance.&nbsp;For more information check out this <a href=\"https:\/\/kinsta.com\/blog\/fastest-wordpress-theme\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">great theme article by Kinsta<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Can I make my own theme?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes you can, but this is a more advanced topic. I don&#8217;t recommend this option to beginners.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How do I customize a theme \/ WordPress website?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The easiest way is to use a theme with a lot of customization options, or using a web builder such as Elementor, or Generate Blocks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also customize a theme by using code (since you have access to the source code).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How do I sell products using WordPress?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few ways to accomplish this but the easiest way is to use WooCommerce.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Install WooCommerce and configure to start selling products instantly. <a href=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/how-to-sell-products-using-wordpress-and-woocommerce\/\">Check out our article to help you start selling products using WooCommerce<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Picking a great theme for WooCommerce is key. We recommend selecting a fast and efficient theme like GeneratePress or OceanWP.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Should I avoid installing plugins?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are good and bad plugins so do plenty of research.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love good-quality plugins.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, you should avoid installing too many plugins, but they are very powerful and can speed up your workflow significantly.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How often should I update my WordPress website?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You should update your website at least once a month. If there are security updates, you should update your website even more often.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will ensure that your website remains secure and runs fast. If you need help and want to save yourself the headache, <a href=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wordpress-developer-calgary\/\">check out our WordPress plans<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How do I update my WordPress website?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Updating your website is easy. Making sure that your website is backed up in case something goes sideways, is critical. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to perform updates (after backing up your website), click on Dashboard &gt; Updates, in your WordPress admin console. Review and apply all updates. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After making updates, make sure that you clear your browser cache, and test the website to make sure everything is working.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why is WordPress Slow? <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is actually really fast out of the box. What makes it slow is poor hosting, installing lots of plugins, and installing slow themes. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to speed up your website, <a href=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/how-to-speed-up-your-wordpress-website\/\">follow the steps outlined in this article<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Is WordPress good for SEO?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In our opinion, WordPress is the best platform for SEO. It&#8217;s fast, responsive, and it&#8217;s tuned for SEO out of the box. Also, you can automate a lot of labour intensive SEO tasks using WordPress. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to find our more, check out <a href=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/why-wordpress-is-the-best-platform-for-seo\/\">our article on why we think WordPress is the best platform for SEO<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Common WordPress Questions Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>That concludes this portion of the most common WordPress questions and answers. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have any other questions that haven\u2019t been covered in this article, <a href=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/contact-us\/\">please contact us<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>WHY CLIO WEBSITES&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Clio Websites is a full service website design company in Calgary.
