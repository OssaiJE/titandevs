It&#8217;s meant to accomplish this without relying on experts to manage its updates while also aiming to remove as many complexities as possible.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The result is a highly stable and secure platform that is updated almost daily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is an intuitive platform that allows you to build nearly any type of content management system or website.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an entrepreneur, you\u2019ll often find yourself going against the popular trend when it comes to creating your eCommerce store.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need step by step instructions to create your eCommerce website, you can <a href=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/how-to-create-a-great-ecommerce-website\/\">check out this guide<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>WordPress as a CMS<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll try many different solutions and platforms but once you discover WordPress, it will be love at first sight. Why?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is the best open source content management system (or CMS) for creating and running an online store.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Clio Websites, <a href=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wordpress-developer-calgary\/\">we\u2019ve been designing and running Calgary eCommerce websites with WordPress<\/a>, and along the way, we\u2019ve learned a small handful of tips and tricks that will make your life easier when getting started on building your online store.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article not only provides you with these valuable tips and tricks but will walk you step by step through the process of deciding which plugins you should choose and what platform to build your eCommerce website on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" src=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/calgary-ecommerce-websites-person-using-laptop.jpg\" alt=\"calgary-ecommerce-websites-person-using-laptop\" class=\"wp-image-6268\" srcset=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/calgary-ecommerce-websites-person-using-laptop.jpg 500w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/calgary-ecommerce-websites-person-using-laptop-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Importance of a Domain Name and Hosting Provider<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before diving into building your eCommerce store on WordPress, you need to choose a domain name and hosting provider.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/how-to-pick-a-good-domain-name-for-your-business\/\">The best domain names<\/a> blend several terms from your niche with keywords. Your domain name doesn\u2019t have to include these keywords outright, but it should reflect them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your domain name is going to be the first thing visitors see when they come to your website, so it\u2019s worth spending time and money on choosing the right one. The most important thing to remember when selecting a domain name is to choose something that you can register and is also memorable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, it\u2019s also important to choose a trusted web hosting company.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You want to be sure that your website will not suffer from downtime and that it loads quickly for your customers.\u00a0Having a reliable hosting provider is key, especially for eCommerce websites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outstanding customer service is also essential because you never know when you&#8217;ll need help with something on your site. A great hosting company will have someone available via live chat or a toll-free phone line who can help you out right away if something goes wrong.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A bonus is having lots of storage space and bandwidth so you&#8217;re not left worrying about how much data you use or how big the files on your website are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Calgary Ecommerce Websites Using WooCommerce<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re looking to sell products on your WordPress website, then you\u2019ll want to know about WooCommerce.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WooCommerce plugin is one of the most popular eCommerce plugins, with a healthy ecosystem around it.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>WooCommerce is a free, open-source eCommerce plugin that\u2019s powering more than three million websites. With its growing popularity, you can be sure there are lots of extensions worth taking a closer look at.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>WooCommerce is:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Easy to set up;<\/li><li>Highly customizable;<\/li><li>Rich in features;<\/li><li>Gives you full ownership over your online store.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You just need to install it and start exploring!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"428\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/clio-websites-shopify-screenshot-laptop-screen.jpg\" alt=\"calgary-ecommerce-websites-clio-websites-shopify-screenshot-laptop-screen\" class=\"wp-image-6269\" srcset=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/clio-websites-shopify-screenshot-laptop-screen.jpg 428w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/clio-websites-shopify-screenshot-laptop-screen-257x300.jpg 257w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 428px) 100vw, 428px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>WordPress vs. Shopify for Ecommerce<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In a nutshell, Shopify is known as the easiest way to create an online store in just a few clicks.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It may take you a while to decide how you want your store to look, but on average it won\u2019t take you more than 15 minutes from start (opening your Shopify account) to finish (launching your store).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a bunch of other reasons why people choose Shopify, although the eCommerce site builder isn\u2019t always the best option if you like having total control over your site. There are plenty of people who opt out of using Shopify in favor of WordPress, Squarespace, or another platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s because <a href=\"http:\/\/shopify.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Shopify <\/a>has its limitations and <a href=\"http:\/\/woocommerce.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WooCommerce <\/a>is way more customizable and allows you to create your eCommerce site just the way you want it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reality is that there are a lot of people who can\u2019t afford eCommerce solutions built on top of WordPress.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These platforms offer you much more flexibility but also require a substantial time investment and cost thousands to set up and maintain. And if you only make a couple of hundred dollars a month in revenue, you can\u2019t afford constant hours spent on optimizing your site. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why choosing the right platform for Calgary eCommerce websites is key.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ecommerce Websites &#8211; Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ecommerce platforms offer many benefits for both sellers and customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When creating Calgary eCommerce Websites, you need to consider many things, such as: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Should you go with a simple solution like a blog or a CMS that allows members to buy products? <\/li><li>Is it better to create a marketplace where sellers and customers meet?<\/li><li>What are the ongoing costs and fees required to support the solution?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>At Clio Websites, we understand that every website is unique and has complex requirements.
