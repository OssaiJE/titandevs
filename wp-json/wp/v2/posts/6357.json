Think of it as your digital real estate. In this article, we will cover how a website can help you grow your business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Designing and building a website is no easy task. There are many decisions to be made which can leave you feeling a little lost. Small business owners are notorious for having a lot on their plate, so don\u2019t let your website hold you back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A website has a primary role in communicating your business message and engaging existing customers and potential prospects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how do you get started building your business online?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Creating a Website with WordPress<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress started off as a blogging platform back in the early 2000s. Since then, <a href=\"https:\/\/kinsta.com\/wordpress-market-share\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">it has grown to power over 40% of\u00a0<strong>all websites\u00a0<\/strong>on the internet<\/a>. WordPress is a content management system (CMS) that offers various capabilities like blogging and e-commerce.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" src=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/how-a-website-can-help-you-grow-your-business-wordpress-guy-clio-websites.jpg\" alt=\"how-a-website-can-help-you-grow-your-business-wordpress-guy-clio-websites\" class=\"wp-image-6359\" srcset=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/how-a-website-can-help-you-grow-your-business-wordpress-guy-clio-websites.jpg 500w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/how-a-website-can-help-you-grow-your-business-wordpress-guy-clio-websites-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Grow Your Business with WordPress<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has been the go-to website platform for companies and corporate users since its release in 2003.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, is it the right solution for your company? WordPress is a standard CMS that allows you to build a wide range of websites, but are all those features necessary for your company? The answer will vary from one situation to another.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your website is your online shop window, and if it\u2019s messy and full of junk, you can be sure that very few people will use it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your products or services are displayed and, just like a real shop, you only have one chance to make an impression on potential clients.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress can be your go-to tool for building a brand as it\u2019s relatively easy to use and highly customizable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some of its most valuable features:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Plugins<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has a wide range of helpful plugins, from SEO to contact forms and your own CMS. Plugins are so easy to install because they can be added directly inside of your WordPress dashboard. These awesome plugins will make you a better website developer and help you make your customers happy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Themes<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are a small business or non-profit, then you can get the majority of what you need through the free default themes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you are attempting to stand out from the crowd and get a premium theme from Elegant Themes or StudioPress, there are some additional steps required like learning how to install and use child themes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a great WordPress theme is just the tip of the iceberg.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are still a lot of technical aspects to consider such as plugin compatibility, usability, security, and more. It\u2019s always a good idea to choose a theme that has great reviews.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, highly-rated WordPress themes offer better customer support and are often updated to fix bugs and security issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" src=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/how-a-website-can-help-you-grow-your-business-wordpress-themes-screenshot-clio-websites.jpg\" alt=\"how-a-website-can-help-you-grow-your-business-wordpress-themes-screenshot-clio-websites\" class=\"wp-image-6364\" srcset=\"https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/how-a-website-can-help-you-grow-your-business-wordpress-themes-screenshot-clio-websites.jpg 500w, https:\/\/cliowebsites.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/how-a-website-can-help-you-grow-your-business-wordpress-themes-screenshot-clio-websites-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Great for SEO<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking full advantage of WordPress\u2019s architecture allows search engines to crawl and index your website which helps with SEO.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress provides a full-fledged CMS that allows you to create custom pages and post groups, so you can effectively leverage HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From changing the meta tags to editing your robots.txt files and sitemap, using WordPress plugins as a starting point allows you to easily edit every aspect of the plugin code.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The amount of customization available is virtually limitless; some plugins include advanced features such as instant uploads from a camera to a WordPress blog, or the ability to automatically publish articles from WordPress-based websites to a host of social media platforms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sharing content has never been easier!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>At Clio WordPress is our bread and butter<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you looking for a WordPress support company or web development company to help you with your project?

Content, in turn, helps you rank on the search engines.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do you make sure that your content is readable, informative and relevant to your audience?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Content SEO means improving the search engine visibility of your content.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can include the creation, distribution, and promotion of relevant quality content to attract more visitors to your website.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But to understand how you can create content superior to that of your competitors, we have to learn what Google considers as quality content, and where it helps a website rank higher in their search engine results pages (SERPs).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the content isn\u2019t up to scratch and well-written, then no matter how beautifully designed your site is or how good your marketing strategy is, it won\u2019t be ranking high in the search engines for your most important keywords and phrases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure that you research what your audience is looking for and searching up in the search engines, and create content around those keywords.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interlink between your articles and mention highly authoritative external resources for a better chance to rank higher on Google.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Leverage Local SEO<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are a local business and targeting customers in your region, then you need to optimize your website for local SEO.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Common tasks associated with local SEO include finding local keywords, optimizing a business&#8217;s Google My Business profile, and building local citations.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea is that well-optimized websites rank better in search engines for local keywords because users are often searching for businesses that are physically close by.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Local SEO is a crucial step in online marketing that is often overlooked or incorrectly executed.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In today\u2019s world, local SEO is no longer something businesses have to do because \u201cit\u2019s just the way it has to be,\u201d but rather a crucial step that can lead to leads and brand awareness from products and services from right around the corner- or across town, or even across the country!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you own a restaurant in Calgary and are not optimizing for local search terms related to your restaurant such as \u201cbest pizza in Calgary,\u201d then you might as well pack your bags and get ready for failure because your bigger competitors will outrank you.

Not only that, but a website can be the difference between an online and offline lead since it can house your whole business portfolio on one platform and direct customers to contact you via phone or email.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people tend to think that their competitors have websites, so they need one too \u2013 so that their business is seen as a major player in their industry.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is certainly true, but it\u2019s not just competitors you need to be concerned about.
